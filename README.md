# 💠 Konigsberg

Interactive Python application for creating, visualizing, and analyzing graph data structures using graph theory concepts.

Built with **Streamlit**, this project allows users to explore graphs in 3D directly from the browser, combining visualization with algorithmic analysis.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To design an interactive environment where users can **build, modify, and analyze graphs** while understanding their structural and algorithmic properties.

The application allows users to:

- Create and label 3D nodes and edges with custom colors and textures  
- Generate directed and undirected graphs with arrow-based edges  
- Assign weights to edges  
- Compute and visually highlight the **shortest path** in weighted graphs  

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Applied

- Graph theory fundamentals (nodes, edges, directed and weighted graphs)
- Shortest path algorithms
- Data structures for graph representation
- Interactive visualization of abstract structures
- User-driven manipulation of graph data

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Streamlit** – interactive web interface
- Graph algorithms implemented in Python
- 3D visualization libraries (if applicable)

## 🙌 Personal Milestones

Through this project, I:

- Implemented graph data structures and traversal logic from scratch  
- Applied shortest path algorithms to real-time user-generated graphs  
- Designed an interactive interface to visualize abstract data structures  
- Connected theoretical concepts from graph theory with practical software implementation  

---

## 💡 Motivation

This project was developed as part of an academic course, but its goal goes beyond a classroom requirement.

The motivation was to:
- Translate **graph theory concepts** into a tangible and interactive tool  
- Explore how **intelligent systems** can assist users in understanding complex structures  
- Combine algorithmic reasoning with visual feedback for better comprehension  

---

## 🖥️ Application Overview

The system is structured around:

- A graph model that stores nodes, edges, directionality, and weights  
- User interactions that dynamically update the graph state  
- Algorithmic modules responsible for path calculation and graph analysis  
- A visualization layer that reflects structural and algorithmic changes in real time  

This separation allows the project to remain modular and extensible.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Support for additional graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, minimum spanning tree)
- Improved performance for larger graphs
- Export/import graph configurations
- Enhanced 3D interaction controls

## 📌 Notes

This project focuses on **conceptual clarity and algorithmic correctness** rather than production-level optimization.
